A ground-up implementation of browser automation for LLMs, built to investigate why existing solutions consistently fail at seemingly simple tasks.

After comparing this implementation against leading browser automation libraries, the results revealed an important insight: all approaches achieved nearly identical failure rates, speeds, and task completion metrics. This suggests the bottleneck isn't in the tooling but in how LLMs fundamentally parse and understand web interfaces.

The real solution likely requires a new abstraction layer or modality for representing browser state. Next steps include using Claude Code to experiment with novel ways of exposing DOM information and potentially developing a specialized language for browser-LLM interaction.
