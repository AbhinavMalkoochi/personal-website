Based on anthropic research on code execution with MCP's that reduced context by 90%. The idea was to convert MCP servers into TS files that could be progressively discovered by the LLMs through file system traversal.

I created a few scripts that would take MCP servers, add them to a servers folder, and for each server, list all the tools available in a TS file. These files simply call the MCP server via stdio with function doc headers.
