Built on Anthropic's research showing 90% context reduction through MCP code execution, this project transforms MCP servers into progressively discoverable TypeScript files.

The system converts MCP servers into a standardized format: each server gets added to a servers folder with corresponding TS files that catalog available tools. These files act as lightweight wrappers, calling the underlying MCP server via stdio while maintaining clean function documentation headers.

This approach enables LLMs to discover and load tools on-demand through file system traversal, dramatically reducing the context window needed for agent operations.
